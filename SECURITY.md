# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently we support versions 1.x.x and above of Hummingbird. These will receive security updates as and when needed.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Hummingbird or any of its related repositories please do not post this in a public forum, do not create a GitHub Issue. Instead you should email [admin@opticalaberration.com](mailto:admin@opticalaberration.com) with details of the issue.

#### What happens next?

* A member of the team will acknowledge receipt of the report within 5
  working days. This may include a request for additional
  information about reproducing the vulnerability.
* We will privately inform the Swift Server Work Group ([SSWG][sswg]) of the
  vulnerability within 10 days of the report as per their [security
  guidelines][sswg-security].
* Once we have identified a fix we may ask you to validate it. We aim to do this
  within 30 days, but this may not always be possible.
* We will decide on a planned release date and let you know when it is.
* Once the fix has been released we will publish a security advisory on GitHub
  and the [SSWG][sswg] will announce the vulnerability on the [Swift
  forums][swift-forums-sec].
